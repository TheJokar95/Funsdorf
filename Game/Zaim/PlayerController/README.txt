It was Hard to make it in 2D because in the tutorial he uses Vector3 (x,y,z)
but we need only Vector2(x,y)[hard because of the MousePosition].

Note:
Dont try to make it Perfect because you will forget about some stuff so be prepared
to open it and put some new stuff inside or Edit/Delete something.
